/**
 * Thrust curve in Manual Mode
 *
 * This parameter defines how the throttle stick input is mapped to commanded thrust
 * in Manual/Stabilized flight mode.
 *
 * In case the default is used ('Rescale to hover thrust'), the stick input is linearly
 * rescaled, such that a centered stick corresponds to the hover throttle (see MPC_THR_HOVER).
 *
 * Select 'No Rescale' to directly map the stick 1:1 to the output. This can be useful
 * in case the hover thrust is very low and the default would lead to too much distortion
 * (e.g. if hover thrust is set to 20%, 80% of the upper thrust range is squeezed into the
 * upper half of the stick range).
 *
 * Note: In case MPC_THR_HOVER is set to 50%, the modes 0 and 1 are the same.
